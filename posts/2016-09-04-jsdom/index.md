# jsdom - An in-JavaScript Implementation of the DOM

jsdom replicates the DOM API with pure JavaScript, which allows us to interact with familiar browser methods and properties without needing an actual  browser.

Not needing a browser means we can interact with a DOM anywhere, like the server. This allows for server-side manipulation and inspection of the DOM, which among other things, is great for testing.
